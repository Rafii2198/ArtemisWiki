All Artemis code resides in a package starting with `com.wynntils`. The rest of this discussion will ignore that part of the package name.

The top level contain these packages:
* `commands`
* `core`
* `features`
* `functions`
* `gui`
* `handlers`
* `mc`
* `models`
* `utils`

They all have well-specified content.
